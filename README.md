- **Update Entries:** Users can easily update information using the PUT endpoint. They can send the updated details in JSON format to modify existing entries.
- **Delete Entries:** Entries can be removed from the database using the DELETE endpoint. Users need to specify the entry's ID to delete a specific entry.


## Development Environment

The Fakad Infotech Application was developed using the following tools:

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store and manage data.
- **Swagger:** Used to generate API documentation for easy reference and testing.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Local Testing

-----------------------------------------------------------------
For local testing, replace the base URL "https://fakad-student-application.onrender.com/application-form" with http://localhost:8080/application-form.

For example, the endpoint "https://fakad-student-application.onrender.com/application-form" should be accessed as "http://localhost:8080/application-form" when testing locally. Everything else in the API request remains the same.
